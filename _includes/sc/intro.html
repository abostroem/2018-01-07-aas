  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  including program design, version control, data management,
  and task automation.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
  
  Computing is an integral part of every aspect of astronomy and astrophysics, 
  but most scientists are never taught how to build, use, validate, and 
  share software. As a result, many spend hours or days doing things badly 
  that could be done well in just a few minutes. The goal of the Software 
  Carpentry Workshop is to change that. The tools presented at this two-day 
  workshop will enable astronomers to spend less time wrestling with software 
  and more time doing research with results that are easier to confirm, 
  distribute, and update.
